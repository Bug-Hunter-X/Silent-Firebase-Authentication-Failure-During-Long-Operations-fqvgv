The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the user's authentication token expires while a long-running operation is in progress.  For instance, consider a large data upload or a complex database transaction.  If the token expires mid-operation, the SDK might not automatically refresh it, leading to a silent failure. This is especially tricky to debug as the initial error might not be directly related to authentication.
